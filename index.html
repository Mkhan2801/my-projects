          <header>Html</header>
          <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
          </p>    
          <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headers, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
          </p>
          <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>
          <div class="code">
          <code>&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt
            <p></p> 
            &lthtml&gt<p></p>
              &lthead&gt<p></p>
                &lttitle&gtThis is a title&lt/title&gt<p></p>
              &lt/head&gt<p></p>
                &ltdiv&gt<p></p>
                    &ltp&gtHello world!&lt/p&gt<p></p>
                &lt/div&gt<p></p>
              &lt/body&gt<p></p>
            &lt/html&gt</code>
            </div>

          <li>button</li>
          <li>image</li>
          <li>text</li>

          <header>CSS</header>
          <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
          </p>
          <p>
              CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
          </p>
          <p> 
              Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
          </p>
          <p>For example, under pre-CSS HTML, a heading element defined with red text would be written as:</p>
         <div class="code"> <code>&lth1&gt&ltfont color="red"&gtChapter 1.&lt/font&gt&lt/h1&gt<P></P></code>
        </div>
        </section>
  
        <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript">
          
          <header>JavaScript</header>
          <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[11] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions.
              </p>
              <p>
              Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[12] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[13] often incorporating third-party libraries.[14] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
              </p>
              <p>
              As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
              </p>
              <p>
              The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
          </p>
          <p>Simple examples
            Variables in JavaScript can be defined using either the var,[70] let[71] or const[72] keywords.</p>
            <div class="code"><code>
              // Declares a function-scoped variable named `x`, and implicitly assigns the<p></p>
  // special value `undefined` to it. Variables without value are automatically<p></p>
  // set to undefined.<p></p>
  var x;<p></p>
  
  // Variables can be manually set to `undefined` like so
  var x2 = undefined;<p></p>
  
  // Declares a block-scoped variable named `y`, and implicitly sets it to<p></p>
  // `undefined`. The `let` keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 2015.<p></p>
  let y;<p></p>
  
  // Declares a block-scoped, un-reassignable variable named `z`, and sets it to<p></p>
  // a string literal. The `const` keyword was also introduced in ECMAScript 2015,<p></p>
  // and must be explicitly assigned to.<p></p>
  
  // The keyword `const` means constant, hence the variable cannot be reassigned<p></p>
  // as the value is `constant`.<p></p>
  const z = "this value cannot be reassigned!";
  <p></p>
  // Declares a variable named `myNumber`, and assigns a number literal (the value<p></p>
  // `2`) to it.<p></p>
  let myNumber = 2;<p></p>
  
  // Reassigns `myNumber`, setting it to a string literal (the value `"foo"`).<p></p>
  // JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, so this is legal.<p></p>
  myNumber = "foo";
            </code></div>

          <header>Python</header>
          <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[31]
              </p>
              <p>
              Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

        <section class="main-section" id="SQL">
         
          <header>SQL</header>
          <p>SQL (/ˌɛsˌkjuːˈɛl/ (About this soundlisten) S-Q-L,[4] /ˈsiːkwəl/ "sequel"; Structured Query Language)[5] is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.
              </p>
              <p>
              SQL offers two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index.
              </p>
              <p>
              Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements,[6] which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: a data query language (DQL),[a] a data definition language (DDL),[b] a data control language (DCL), and a data manipulation language (DML).[c][7] The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is essentially a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.

          <header>PHP</header>
          <p>PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development.[7] It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.[8] The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.[9] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,[8] but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[10]
              </p>
              <p>
              PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications[11] and robotic drone control.[12] PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.
          </p>
          <p>An example of the early PHP syntax:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              &lt!--include /text/header.html--&gt<p></p>
  
  &lt!--getenv HTTP_USER_AGENT--&gt<p></p>
  &lt!--if substr $exec_result Mozilla--&gt<p></p>
    Hey, you are using Netscape!&ltp&gt<p></p>
      &lt!--endif--&gt<p></p>
      
      &lt!--sql database select * from table where user='$username'--&gt<p></p>
      &lt!--ifless $numentries 1--&gt<P></P>
        Sorry, that record does not exist&ltp&gt<p></p>
      &lt!--endif exit--&gt<P></P>
        Welcome &lt!--$user--&gt!&ltp&gt<P></P>
        You have &lt!--$index:0--&gt credits left in your account.&ltp&gt<P></P>
      
      &lt!--include /text/footer.html--&gt
            </code>
          </div>
          <P>Early PHP was not intended to be a new programming language, and grew organically, with Lerdorf noting in retrospect: "I don't know how to stop it, there was never any intent to write a programming language [...] I have absolutely no idea how to write a programming language, I just kept adding the next logical step on the way."[20] A development team began to form and, after months of work and beta testing, officially released PHP/FI 2 in November 1997.</P>

          <p>Java (Indonesian: Jawa, Indonesian pronunciation: [ˈdʒawa]; Javanese: ꦗꦮ; Sundanese: ᮏᮝ) is one of the Greater Sunda Islands in Indonesia. It is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and the Java Sea to the north. With a population of 151.8 million, including the inhabitants of its surrounding islands, principally Madura, Java constitutes 56.1 percent of the Indonesian population. 147.7 million people live on Java itself, making it the world's most populous island.[1]
              </p>
              <p>
              Indonesia's capital city, Jakarta, is on Java's northwestern coast. Much of the well-known part of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally. Four of Indonesia's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: Ujung Kulon National Park, Borobudur Temple, Prambanan Temple, and Sangiran Early Man Site.

          <header>C++</header>
          <p>C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.[9]
              </p>
              <p>
              C++ was designed with an orientation toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[10] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[10] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).
          </p>
          <P>C++ inherits most of C's syntax. The following is Bjarne Stroustrup's version of the Hello world program that uses the C++ Standard Library stream facility to write a message to standard output:</P>
